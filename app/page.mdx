# Hello World!

This is the [MDX Starter Template](https://github.com/brijr/mdx-starter).

Welcome to this **Markdown** example document! Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to structurally valid HTML.

## Headers

Headers are created by adding one or more `#` before your header text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the header.

### This is an H3

This is a level 3 heading, which is often used for subsections within a major section or for smaller divisions within a document. It is smaller than the H2 heading but larger than the lower-level headings.

#### This is an H4

This is a level 4 heading, which is commonly used for sub-subsections or smaller divisions within a document. It is smaller than the H3 heading and is typically used for more granular organization of content.

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text with bold or italics.

- **Bold**: `**bold**`
- _Italics_: `*italics*`

## Lists

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code

You can present code blocks using three backticks ``` or by indenting lines with four spaces.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

Inline code can be done with single backticks: `inline code`.

## Blockquotes

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

## Horizontal Rule
